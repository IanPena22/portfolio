          <h2>Family that last</h2>
          <p>Here is my family, a happy yet complex family that visits occasionally; family that plays and laughs together, every one of them believe in the good old virtues
            of love and sacrifice and having that sharing, caring, loving attitude towards each other. That feeling of togetherness and belonging and a strong sense of loyalty to one another.

          <h2>Camaraderie, comradeship.</h2>
          <p>Ever since I enrolled at St. Dominic College of Asia, I thought it was going to be an ordinary school year where I was isolating myself again. But that proved me wrong, I believe some of the 
            best friendships are unexpected, I was sure wrong. Occasionally however, I found that unanticipated relationship. We've all had friendships that started from either work or school and it just made since to befriend these people because they were part of our everyday lives. But if you're lucky enough, you have made a few unexpected friendships throughout your life. I have made some very unexpected friendships in my life and these are friendships that will last a lifetime. By unexpected, I mean people who walk into your life without you going to "look" for them.

          <h1>Attaintment</h1>
          <h2>Opportunies don't happen, you create them</h2>
          <p>The achievements, successes or accomplishments we gain in school are the part of best school life years.  Those achievements in middle, high school or college student life may include personal academic achievements and sports or extracurricular achievements. They may be greatest, the best or the bad but we never forget them. Achievement is associated with the targeted goals or aims in life. When we define our action in relation to something like a goal a task is created. A task when fulfilled is called an achievement earned. The struggle in life is the sum total of our achievements, success, failures, mistakes.</p>

          <h1>Yours Truly</h1>
          <h2>The writer</h2>
          <p>It's hard to think about my own personal future when I have not experience much of life as of now. there are so many paths I could take. I can only hope that I can make a wise and careful decisions about my life. 
            Every choice I make affects my future, one goal I definitely see in my future is graduating from college.  Today, itâ€™s hard to succeed and live comfortably without a college degree. I have made my education a top priority and fully intend on fulfilling my goal of graduating. In high school I was an average student. Throughout college I want to be a great student. Average is no longer an option. I see myself graduating college with honors and awards.
